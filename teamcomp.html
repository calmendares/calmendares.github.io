    <h1>Team Composition</h1>
<br>
A well organized team composition is half of the battle in Overwatch. Having a team that is well balanced and works well together is important to victory, even before the battle begins. Let us discuss the most basic team composition in Overwatch:
<br>
<br>
<h2>Basic Composition</h2>
The majority of team compositions have 1 designated Healer, 1 designated Tank, and 4 Damage dealers, known as DPS (damage per second). It is necessary to have a wall for the team to hide behind and a healer to create a safe zone for your team. This team composition is often used in casual play, but lacks a backup plan for when one of these core heroes dies. These characters will be close to the objective most of the time because they are the best when positioned on it. This composition is found in casual play, where the game is not taken as competitively.
<br>
Currently, the most popular team composition in the game is 2 Tanks, 2 Healers, 2 DPS. The reason for this is the ability to continue and turn around a fight if one of a specific hero dies.
